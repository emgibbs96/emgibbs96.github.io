<p class="leader">As a self-declared TV show enthusiast, something that drives me absolutely crazy is inconsistencies. As an English major, something that drives me crazy is lazy writing. Unfortunately, many of my favorite shows include both of these things. Of course, no show can ever be perfect, but this blog aims to take a look at tv shows and how these errors have created bigger problems than just an annoying plot hole. Continuity errors plague the rest of the show and can create big problems in even the funniest of shows.</p>
