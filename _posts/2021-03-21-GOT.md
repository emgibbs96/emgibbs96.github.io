# Game of Thrones - Dragons & Chains
### March 21, 2021 - Emma Gibbs

Game of Thrones is one of the biggest things to come out of the 2000s so far. It took the world by storm when it premiered 2011. It has won a record-breaking number of awards and was beloved by millions and millions of people. The amount of time and money that went into making this show is astronomical, and it shows. While show is far too complicated to try and explain well, the extremely simple version is there are many royal families all fighting for the Iron Throne while trying to ward off an invasion from the White Walkers and their army of the undead. It a fantastical, medieval tale that somehow has something for everyone. This show is one I regarded as the gold standard of writing for a very long time. There is so much detail and intricacy within story lines and how much they intersect that I was always amazed with how well they could keep it all straight; that is, until the last couple of seasons. Near the end, the writing for the show fell apart. There were big story arcs left in the dust, character development was torn down, and nothing made sense. 
	
While there are a lot of big, glaring problems within these seasons, I want to look at one that may not seem as obvious as some of the others. After establishing deep seated lore about these Wights (the undead soldiers) they completely contradict themselves in the matter of one episode. In Season 7, Episode 6 (spoilers ahead), a group of heroes find themselves being chased by the Wights. They run out on to a frozen lake, where the weight of all of the Wights running across it causing it to [break.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts_R3CX63sM) It is shown that the Wights cannot swim or get through the water, as they create a circle surrounding the group in the middle of the lake. The idea that the Wights wonâ€™t even attempt to go in the water is planted into the viewers head as a good deal of time is shown passing without them even attempting to walk out on the water. 

As the scene progresses, the Wights figure out the ice is thick enough for them to all walk on and they attack the group of men in the middle. They are rescued by one of the Queens, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clark), and her three dragons come to save them. Unfortunately (SPOILER), one of her dragons is killed in the battle. It sinks down below the icy water, where one would assume it would stay. BUT, at the end of the episode, the Wights are seen [pulling the dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTwcbTOnlU) out of the water with big chains (where did they come from?). 

For a show that once dedicated so much time to sticking to their lore, this continuity error was painful. How did they get the chains on to the dragon? Could the swim the whole time? Why would they stake a whole group of heroes surviving on a fact that is later disproven in its own story line? Unfortunately, this was the only the beginning of the writing carelessness that would plague the remainder of GOT, but this is a prime example of careless writing ruining a show that was once praised for how well thought out their plot points and lore was written.
