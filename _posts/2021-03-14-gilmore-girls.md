## Gilmore Girls - Lorelai the First
### March 14, 2021 - Emma Gibbs

Gilmore Girls is a show that revolves around a mother, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), and daughter, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bidel), trying to figure out life together in a small town in Connecticut. It is heartwarming, homey, and a little bit hokey in the best of ways. It’s a show I love so much that I plan to rewatch it every Fall for the rest of my life. While this show seems to do a bit better on the number continuity errors, there are still a few that really throw a wrench in the flow of the show.

Lorelai is named after her father’s mother. In the third episode of the show, both of Lorelai’s parents mention that the original Lorelai has passed away after learning Rory did not know about her. Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) she received her dinner plates from her husband’s mother. She refers the Lorelai the first in the past tense when she does this. Richard Gilmore (Edward Herrmann) then goes on to say, "Lorelai the First was my mother. She was an extremely accomplished equestrian, a distinguished patron of the arts, and she was also world-famous for her masquerade balls. She was quite a woman, my mother." It is obvious they are speaking about the first Lorelai in the past tense, insinuating that she had passed away. 

This story point is an example of one of the glaring plot holes within the show. 15 episodes later, this claim of the first Lorelai’s death is completely disregarded, as Season 1, Episode 18 revolves around Lorelai and Rory spending time with the first Lorelai as they have not seen her in years and years. Emily is running through the house collecting all of the presents the first Lorelai has given her throughout the years to display them. Richard enjoys his mother’s company as she has him wrapped around her finger. Grandmother Lorelai (Marion Ross) or “Trix” as she likes to be called, appears several times throughout the next several seasons before passing away (for what may be the second time?) in the fourth season. They even hold a [funeral.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWWjpDbi88M)

These types of errors throw off an entire storyline. The audience was told that Richard’s mother had passed away, and that Rory did not even know her name. In episode 18, though, it seems like Rory at least has an awareness of who she is as she asks Lorelai about her before they meet. I wonder why this was done in the story and it sends me on a long line of tangents whenever I think about this particular problem too much. Once again, with this show having a decently strong story line, meaning the plot builds on itself as it goes, this seems like a careless mistake to make.
